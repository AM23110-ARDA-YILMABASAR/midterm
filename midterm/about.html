    <h2>About Me</h2>
    

<p>Merhaba! I’m Arda Yılmabaşar, a passionate and curious Mechanical Engineering student currently in my second year at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan. Originally from Istanbul, Turkey, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of design, manufacturing, and innovation.</p>

<p>My academic focus lies in areas like CNC machining, 3D printing, and digital manufacturing systems. Outside the classroom, I enjoy exploring hands-on engineering challenges, developing startup ideas, and learning about how modern technology transforms traditional industries.</p>

<p>Having grown up around automation equipment due to my father’s business, I developed an early interest in precision machinery, which naturally led me to pursue mechanical engineering. Since then, I’ve taken part in research projects, design expos, and even startup bootcamps, continuously expanding my technical and entrepreneurial skills.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy skiing in Japan’s scenic mountains, collecting coins, and building model airplanes. I thrive in multicultural environments and love making new friends while discovering different perspectives.</p>
